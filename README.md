# üí≥ Card Cost API

## üßæ Description

**Card Cost API** Its goal is to expose a REST API that allows querying the clearing cost of a credit/debit card using its number (PAN), as well as performing CRUD operations on the table of costs associated with each issuing country.

## üîß Exposed Endpoints

### Get cost by card number
- **POST** `/api/payment-cards-cost`
```json
{
  "card_number": "4571736009872913"
}
```
**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "country": "AR",
  "cost": 77
}
```
- **Response (200 OK)**:
- **Response (429 Too many request)**
- **Response (503 Service Unavailable)**

---

### CRUD operations for country cost

#### üì• Create new cost
- **POST** `/api/cost`
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "country": "UY",
  "cost": 90.1
}
```
- **Response (201 Created)**:
```json
{
  "country": "UY",
  "cost": 90.1
}
```

#### üìñ Get cost by country
- **GET** `/api/cost/{country}`
- **Path Param**: country code (e.g. `US`, `GR`)
- **Response (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "country": "US",
  "cost": 5.0
}
```
- **Response (404 Not Found)** if the country is not found

#### üìù Update cost by country
- **PUT** `/api/cost/{country}`
- **Path Param**: country code (e.g. `US`, `GR`)
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "country": "US",
  "cost": 6.5
}
```
- **Response (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "country": "US",
  "cost": 6.5
}
```
- **Response (404 Not Found)** if not found

#### ‚ùå Delete cost by country
- **DELETE** `/api/cost/{country}`
- **Path Param**: country code
- **Response (204 No Content)**

## üö® Error Handling

The API handles errors in a centralized way with consistent responses. Some covered scenarios:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid data or validation errors.
- **404 Not Found**: Country or resource not found.
- **409 Conflict**: Integrity violation or duplicates.
- **424 Failed Dependency**: Error in external dependencies (e.g. binlist.net).

---

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven 3.x

### Local execution
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

---


### ü•™ Profiles and External Dependency Simulation

By default, the app uses the real `binlist.net` API.

To simulate the external service and avoid real HTTP calls, you can activate the Spring profile `fake_client`:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=fake_client
```

The fake client:
- Applies the same **rate-limiting** and **circuit breaker** constraints
- Enforces the same SLA as the real API: **5 requests per hour**
- Useful for **offline development**, **resilience testing**, or when the real service is down

---

## üß™ Testing

To run all tests:
```bash
mvn test
```

---

## üê≥ Running with Docker Compose

If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can easily run the app with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This builds the image from the `Dockerfile` and exposes the API at:

> http://localhost:8080

No external DB is required since the app uses an **embedded H2 database** for temporary persistence.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- While the exercise specifies a 6-digit BIN, further research indicates that the standard length is 8 digits.
  Therefore, validation has been adjusted to reflect this.

---

## üìà Scalability and Future Improvements

- Designed for scalability, but current implementation uses in-memory cache, and rate limiter which should be adapted for distributed environments before horizontal scaling.
- Persistence layer decoupled using interface (`ClearingCostRepository`), allowing easy replacement of JPA with Redis, DynamoDB, or other services without changing business logic
- Follows SOLID principles, especially **Open/Closed** and **Dependency Inversion**, to facilitate extensibility and testing
- **Clear separation of responsibilities** (Controller, Service, Repository, External Client)

## üîí Concurrency, Caching, Resilience Strategy

To prevent multiple concurrent requests from hitting the external provider (`https://lookup.binlist.net`), a combination of in-memory caching, per-BIN locking, rate limiting, and circuit breaking has been implemented:

- **In-memory cache (Guava):** It stores both valid responses (country codes) and a `"NOT_FOUND"` marker for invalid BINs, to avoid redundant external calls.

- **Custom Rate Limiter:** A sliding window rate limiter prevents exceeding a configurable number of requests per minute to the external API.

- **Circuit Breaker** The external call is protected with a `@CircuitBreaker` (Resilience4j). If the provider starts failing (e.g., too many `5xx/4xx` errors), the breaker opens and temporarily blocks access to prevent further overload.
This strategy reduces external calls, protects the provider, and ensures a reliable and consistent experience under high concurrency.
Although the Rate Limiter handles 429 errors, the Circuit Breaker protects the API from other external failures like timeouts, connection issues, or unexpected responses. It opens the circuit after detecting repeated failures to avoid system overload.

   #### Key Configuration:

   - `minimumNumberOfCalls=5`: Requires at least 5 calls to evaluate failures.
   - `failureRateThreshold=50`: If 50% of calls fail, the circuit opens.
   - `slidingWindowSize=10`: Sliding window of 10 calls for failure evaluation.
   - `waitDurationInOpenState=30s`: Stays open for 30 seconds once triggered.
   - `permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=2`: Allows 2 trial calls in half-open state.
   - `automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled=true`: Automatically switches to half-open mode.
   - `ignore-exceptions=com.ng.exceptions.TooManyRequestsException`: Ignores 429 errors managed by the rate limiter.
